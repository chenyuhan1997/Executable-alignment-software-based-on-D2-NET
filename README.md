Executable alignment software based on D2-NET


This article is based on the D2-NET build. We have added a pyQT UI interface for easier use. 
When used, its featuremap is saved in the featuremap folder. 
Meanwhile, please download the model ground model file by yourself, and the model should be placed in the models folder.


We use: d2_tf.pth
mkdir models
wget https://dusmanu.com/files/d2-net/d2_ots.pth -O models/d2_ots.pth
wget https://dusmanu.com/files/d2-net/d2_tf.pth -O models/d2_tf.pth
wget https://dusmanu.com/files/d2-net/d2_tf_no_phototourism.pth -O models/d2_tf_no_phototourism.pth
